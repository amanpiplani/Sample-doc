      <p>A signed JWT token will need to be provided by the Partner in the request header for the DFS gateway to authenticate the signature.A Public Key or JWK endpoint must be registered to the gateway using the API key and secret provided in the developer portal.</p>
      <p>To push new Public Keys so that your Private Key may be used for JWT signing or to register the JWK endpoint, the following API has been made available:</p>

      <h3>mTLS X.509 Certificates Exchange</h3>
      <p>Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication ensures that traffic is both secure and trusted in both directions between a client (partner)and server (DFS). With a root certificate authority (CA) in place, Access only allows requests from devices with a corresponding client certificate.</p>
      <p>The mTLS certificates can be exchanged offline over secured channel (such as via Secure email). The process would be as follows:</p>
      <p>DFS will share Root and Intermediate Certificates to API clients. These certificates will be signed by 3rd Party public CA which Partner must add to trust store. DFS would require Root (and Intermediate, if applicable) certificate(s) from API clients. Certificate(s) shall be signed by public CA - an API Consumer or 3rd Party public CA</p>
